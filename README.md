This repo automates my profile picture in the Hack Club Slack! Head to [pfp.ella.cx](https://pfp.ella.cx) to change my profile picture to a random cat picture. It resets to <img src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T0266FRGM/ellathonk/cf1cbe408cfc3596.png" width="20" height="20" /> every 15 minutes though.

### Develop

This Next.js project is deployed on Vercel and uses the yarn package manager. To get set up, first, set environment variables in `.env`:

```
SLACK_TOKEN=
```
Then install dependencies and run it locally at localhost:3000.

```
yarn
yarn dev
# go to localhost:3000
```
